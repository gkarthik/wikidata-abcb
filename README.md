##Description

Given a pathway identifier from wikipathways, the code generates a network of related genes and pathways. 
Keep cytoscape open while running code. please note that the code will start a new session in Cytoscape. 

The code curently generates network for DNA mismatch repair pathway in homo sapiens. Identifier: WP3381.

Custom Style
Background: black
pathway nodes: pink
Gene nodes : green

Gene-Pathway edge in yellow..
Pathway-Gene edge in blue.

Network that will be generrated in cytoscape with a custom defined style.
